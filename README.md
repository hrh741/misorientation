Misorientation
==============

Misorientation is a script that allows you to determine misorientation axis and angle across a grain boundary between two crystals A and B of known orientation (2 sets of Euler angles) and crystal parameters (a,b,c, alpha, beta, gamma). The two crystals are represented on a stereographic projection.
