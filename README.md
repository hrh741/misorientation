Misorientation
==============

Misorientation is a script that allows you to determine misorientation axis and angle across a grain boundary between two crystals A and B of known orientation (2 sets of Euler angles) and crystal parameters (a,b,c, alpha, beta, gamma). 

## Requirements
* Python 2.7 with Matplotlib 2.1.1, Numpy 1.13.3, Tkinter, Pillow 5.3.0 (available through [Enthought Canopy](https://store.enthought.com/downloads/) or [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distributions for instance).
* Mac users need to install [Active Tcl](http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads).
* Run the script python /my-path-to-the-script/misorientation.py

# User Guide


The two crystals are represented on a stereographic projection, as shown below.

## Plot procedure
* Enter the crystal structure or import it from the menu bar. The structure can be modified/added by modifying the structure.txt file. The format is: name a b c alpha beta gamma space group. 
* Enter the maximum indice to define the number of poles/directions.
* Enter the Euler angles of crystal A and B
* Click the Plot button
 
## Misorientation procedure

* Click on the misorientation button with "Show indices" button ticked. The misorientation axes will be shown

* By ticking "Show angle", "Show axes" and "Show numbers" followed by "Misorientation" will show respectively the misorientation angle, axes indices and a number. All these data can be exported in a txt file, located in the parent directory, using the menu "Save" and "Save data".

## Additional plotting features
* Modify the number of poles/directions shown by increasing the d value (interplanar distance) by a given increment.
* Draw directions instead of poles by ticking the uvw button before plotting.
*  Add a pole/direction by clicking the "Add" button, or a family of equivalent poles/directions (circular permutations of the indices) by clicking "Symmetry"
*  Draw a plane by clicking the "Plane" button.

(For hexagonal structure, the third indice is omitted for poles).
